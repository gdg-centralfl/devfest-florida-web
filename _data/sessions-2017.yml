  description:  "An increasing number of social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat and Messenger are using video features. With modern Android devices having enough processing power to run video processing algorithms locally, there's no need to send videos through expensive internet bandwidth to be processed on the backend. Overlays, transcoding and cropping are just a few of the challenges you face when working with video on-device. In this talk I will go through my experience experimenting with built-in as well as third party libraries for video manipulation on Android. We will look at the benefits of two leading media processing libraries, and how you can leverage them to enhance Android's native MediaCodec API to accomplish these tasks. You will walk away with a head start on how to tackle the most common challenges with videos on Android."

  description: "Reactive Programming with RxJava has widely been adopted by both backend services and Android applications alike. Yet, the steep learning curve leaves many developers hesitant about adding it to their own Software tool belt. I was one such developer. Over the past two years, I‚Äôve watched countless videos, read numerous blog posts and attended several conference talks on the subject. Yet, I often left each experience feeling only slightly more knowledgeable, but not quite empowered to start using RxJava in my apps. That‚Äôs not going to happen today!
  <br/><br/>
  In this talk, we‚Äôre going to cover the bare minimum concepts you need to grok, in order to start using RxJava today. In particular, we‚Äôre going to focus on:<br/><br/>
    * The 3 O‚Äôs: Observable, Observer and Operator<br/>
    * The most common Operators: map(), flatMap(), and filter()<br/>
    * Understanding those Marble Diagrams<br/>
    * How Kotlin helps to simplify the code
  <br/><br/>
  Reactive Programming is not going away any time soon. It‚Äôs a powerful way to create asynchronous, event-based applications. It allows developers the ability to craft applications that can easily combine multiple network calls, gracefully handle failures, all while providing a snappy user experience. I want everyone to feel comfortable with the basic concepts of RxJava. Today can be your first step..."
