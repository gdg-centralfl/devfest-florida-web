**We're starting ticket sales for DevFest Florida!**

We wanted to offer our fans, attendees from last year and anyone else excited for this year to get a great deal.

To save at least **20%** off of an early bird ticket get yourself a Faithful Supporter ticket today. These Faithful Supporter tickets are **$80**. We're selling these to give you a break while we get our venue booked. Once our venue is booked tickets will go up in price.

Last year we had some truly expert speakers. Four of whom are part of the Google Developer Experts program and all were experts in their field and gave some truly incredible talks.

These are only available for a short while and once they're gone they're gone. This ticket gets you:

🎟️  Into DevFest for the day

🏷️  Personalized badge & lanyard

🎙  Access to the keynote and all the sessions [2016 Speakers](/speakers-2016/) and [2016 Sessions](/schedule/)

🍽️  Lunch

🍻  Access to the after conference party

🏆  Chances to win prizes

🛍️  Swag bag!
