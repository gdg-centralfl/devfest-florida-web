Orlando is the home of DevFest Florida 2017. However while you're not at the conference there is so much more to enjoy the weekend of
November 5th. While many of you know about a certain mouse that calls the area home we'd like to share all of the other events that are
going on in Orlando that weekend.

### **Walt Disney World**

As we mentioned before Walt Disney World is one of Orlando's largest attractions. With four theme parks, two water parks and world class
dining and spas Disney World is a great place to enjoy. During this weekend [Epcot](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/epcot/)
is hosting the 2016 Epcot International Food & Wine festival where you can enjoy food, wine and beer from around the world at over
30 pavilions in the park. This is a fantastic event if you consider yourself a foodie or if you just like good food. If you're not
interested in buying a ticket to the park, [Disney Springs](https://www.disneysprings.com) is a free venue to enjoy top notch shopping
and dining. Be it Splitsville® bowling, House of Blues® or Cirque de Soleil® La Nouba you're bound to have a fantastic time. There is just
too much to cover here so check them out, but be sure to stop by Vivoli il Gelato if you go. Cap the day off at the parks with amazing
firework shows!

Are you a space nerd like us? The [Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex](https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/) is a great place to visit.
While Google has their Android park, Kennedy Space Center has the Rocket Garden. While you walk around and inside the rockets you can get
a sense as to what it must have been like to be blasted off into space. Too much excitement? Check out the Space Shuttle Atlantis exhibit
where you can see the Space Shuttle up close and enjoy interactive exhibits.

**Where to find:** [Kennedy Space Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kennedy+Space+Center+Visitor+Complex/@28.523273,-80.68161,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4eb14063f30a478b?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjokaD88oLOAhXDNx4KHcfoAacQ_BIIezAQ), SR 405, Titusville, FL 32899

[Universal CityWalk](https://www.universalorlando.com/Nightlife/Citywalk-Nightlife.aspx) sits right between
[Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure](https://www.universalorlando.com) theme parks but is a FREE entertainment complex where you
can dine, dance and play the night away until 2am. Enjoying margaritas at Jimmy Buffett’s® Margaritaville®, a Cajun street party at
Pat O’Brien’s®, or enjoy a Blue Man Group show. This area is a blast and if you want to pop over into one of the theme parks, maybe check
out the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, they're right there. Just a great place to check out for drinks and live music.
From dance floor to karaoke stage, these are nights you’ll never forget!

### **Beaches**

Not a lot of tech conferences have so many great beaches nearby. Cocoa Beach and Daytona Beach are about an hours drive away.
Feeling more adventurous and want to experience the Gulf of Mexico? Tampa's beaches are about a two hour drive away. There aren't a
lot of beaches you can enjoy in November across the country but Florida is home to a bunch of them!
