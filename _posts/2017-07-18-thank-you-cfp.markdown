We want to thank all of you that have submitted your abstracts for talks at this year's [DevFest Florida](https://twitter.com/devfestflorida){:target="%95blank"}!

This year we surpassed last years submissions with almost 4 times as many submissions. We've received submissions from all over the world as well as local developers in Tampa, St. Pete, Orlando & Melbourne based. We'll be evaluating all the submissions in the coming weeks and plan to have our announcements made by the end of July.

With the all the awesome talks, and we're not throwing that word around to be nice they are truly fantastic talk submissions, we can only select some to fit into our one (1) day event. Please do not get discouraged if you are not selected. We'll try to provide a detailed reasoning for you if you find your talk not selected and plan to offer all anyone not selected a nice sized discount on the ticket price. Perhaps next year this turns into a two day event?

On the bright side with all the truly fantastic talks submitted this year is going to be EPIC! Fantastic talks about Android, Angular, React, IoT, VR/AR, Google Home, Machine Learning and all in warm, sunny Florida with Mickey Mouse.
