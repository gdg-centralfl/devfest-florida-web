One of the great things about DevFest Florida is that it's made possible by the generosity of our sponsors. This year that proves to be true once more.

Sourcetoad is our first **Silver sponsor** this year. Please help us say thank you to [Sourcetoad](https://sourcetoad.com) by following them on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sourcetoad), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sourcetoad/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company-beta/5185261/)

Sourcetoad is a technology consulting and software development company that specializes in large-scale software installations for cruise, educational technology and healthcare customers. We help clients solve complicated problems through both software development and business process consulting.

We are excited to be a sponsor for DevFest Florida 2017. Florida is a great place to live and work, and it's important that tech companies based in the state do everything they can to foster the indigenous developer community. There's a lot of talent here, and events like DevFest make sure it stays current on all the latest trends.

Sourcetoad has built a core competency in the world of IoT, from platform management all the way to front-end application development. DevFest Florida will give us an opportunity to share some of this knowledge with the community at large.

Thank you Sourcetoad!
