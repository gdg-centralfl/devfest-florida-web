![Two weeks left for submitting talks?]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/posts/two-weeks.png){: .img-responsive .center-block }

We want to thank everyone that's submitted so far.

We've almost tripled the number of submissions from last year. That's pretty crazy! All of the submissions are inspiring. It is going to be tough to select our speakers this year only because we have so many talented people submitting talks.

We even added a THIRD track to DevFest Florida to accommodate as much of the great talks as possible.

There's two weeks left to submit your talks to DevFest Florida. The CFP closes on **July 17th 11:59pm**. Share this on social media with colleagues and e-mail that co-worker that said they wanted to submit but hasn't yet. There's still time so get to it.
