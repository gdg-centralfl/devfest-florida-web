Each of the organizers is going to share a bit about why they're interested in organizing DevFest Florida. Here's my story.

My name is Michael Traverso. I'm a Google Developer Group organizer in Tampa Bay and I'm also the founder of a mobile software consulting business. I've written mobile apps for Twitter, Ringling Brothers' Circus, the New York Yankees, various startups and the Hillary 2016 campaign. Before that I worked on proprietary portfolio management systems on Wall Street.

Moving to Tampa from NYC in 2011 and not knowing many people I picked up jogging, running four miles a day. It's a fantastic way clear your head and get outside. In 2013, I started feeling sick and running was becoming harder and then almost impossible. Turns out I had stage 3 colon cancer.

Since then I've had surgeries, multiple rounds of chemo and a round of radiation. All of which really put a damper on getting on an airplane and flying around the country to attend tech conferences. This is pretty frustrating when you're a Google Developer Group organizer and you're almost guaranteed a ticket to I/O.

Instead of waiting for someone else to throw a big tech conference with incredibly talented speakers, lots of attendees, swag, a sticker table (because is it really a conference without a sticker table?) and be a quick drive away. I started to think about running a tech conference right here in Florida. I brought the idea up to some fellow GDG organizers in the central Florida area. Together we organized our inaugural DevFest Florida in 2016.

We had about 70 people in attendance. While rather modest in size we had some AMAZING speakers, a great venue and really enthusiastic attendees. I was proud of the quality & diversity of the speaker lineup we put together. It was a fantastic event that brought together some of the best and brightest to showcase tech in Florida.

Most of the world knows Florida for three things. In no specific order they are: Oranges, Disney World and crazy news reports. What a lot of folks don't know about Florida is just how much tech talent there is down here. Especially in Tampa, Orlando, the Space Coast, Jacksonville and Miami. There's a ton of really good incubators for tech startups like Tampa Bay WaVE in Tampa and Canvs in Orlando. Treehouse, The Iron Yard and Code School are all here too.

I'm sure there are dozens of other big cities that can claim the same story: lots of tech talent and lots of startups. BUT I haven't read about one with great beaches, good weather, 3 big theme parks and no state tax.

Florida is a GREAT place for tech. People that live and work in tech here can tell you that. We want to share that with all of you. We are expanding this year with lessons learned from last year.

We're an inclusive, affordable tech conference surrounded by fun stuff to see and do. Make a family vacation out of the weekend and visit one of the theme parks, water parks, beaches, outlet shopping for the holidays.

We hope that you'll join us in Disney World on November 11th! Tickets now are $100 and are available at [https://devfestflorida.eventbrite.com](https://devfestflorida.eventbrite.com).
