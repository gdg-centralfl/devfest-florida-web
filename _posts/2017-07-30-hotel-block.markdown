If you're a speaker or are coming in from out of town and want to stay a few nights and enjoy Disney World we've got a pretty sweet deal.

The Walt Disney World Swan Resort is located in the [Epcot Resort Area](http://www.wdwinfo.com/maps/epcot-resort-area.htm). What does this mean? This means that when you walk out of the hotel you are a short walk to the [Epcot](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/epcot/) & [Hollywood Studios](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/hollywood-studios/) theme parks. So if you were interested in enjoying the [Food & Wine Festival](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/events-tours/epcot/epcot-international-food-and-wine-festival) at Epcot OR the [Toy Story](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/hollywood-studios/toy-story-mania/) and [Star Wars](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/attractions/hollywood-studios/star-wars/) rides & pavilions at Hollywood Studios they're just a short walk (or boat ride) away!

We've negotiated a great discount on this recently renovated hotel. The hotel is **$199/night** with discounted parking. To take advantage of this deal please  

### Call **1-800-227-1500**<br>Mention **DevFest Florida** or group code **TS17**<br>Mon-Fri 7am-11pm & Sat-Sun 7am-7pm###

The added advantages to staying at the Swan Resort include:

* Conference provided shuttle transportation to the conference and back to the hotel.
* Lots of FREE options to get to the theme parks (e.g. walking, boats, buses out front).
* Extra magic hours at the theme parks.*
* Enjoy the Boardwalk area with shops, restaurants & entertainment.
* Nice view of the Epcot fireworks at night from the resort area.

### Why use the room block rate?
For starters, the current rates on travel websites for this hotel is **$219/night**. As we approach the conference date this will only go up as lots of Floridians enjoy staying at these hotels since they're the cheapest hotels on Disney property... and they can walk to the Food & Wine Festival going on at Epcot.
